Notes:

I don't understand ARP (will clarify later)


CLI:
- within the CLI type "enable" to enable administrator permissions

- the "show mac-address-table" command in the CLI of a switch will not display network information unless all devices have been pinged
  - example: this network had four computers. PC0 pinged PC1, PC2, & PC3, then PC1, PC2, & PC3 all pinged PC0

- devices in the same network can communicate with one another locally
