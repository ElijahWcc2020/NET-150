RIP version 2 can be configured in the CLI on a router
  CLI > enable > config terminal > router rip > version 2 > network x.x.x.x
  
Simulation mode can be used to analyze packets sent throughout the network
  I don't really understand the API menu details

The "Show ip route" command is also something I'm a bit confused on
  I believe it displays all networks that the router has routes set up for
  It also displays whether the routes are connected, static, etc.
