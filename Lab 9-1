Routing Notes
  - I am not entirely sure what routing is
  - I believe a route is the "route" a packet takes when traveling from one network to another
  - Routes can be set up in the CLI on packet tracer
    - CLI > enter > enable > config terminal > R3(config)#ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.3 (this last line is just an example)
    
  - Static Routing
    - Cheaper
    - Better for smaller networks
    - Requires more maintenence
    - Does not automatically assign routes
    - If any link between routers fails, the entire path is affected (not sure what this means but I read it online)
    
  - Dynamic Routing
    - More expensive
    - Better for larger networks
    - More difficult to set up
    - Automatically assigns routes
    - Uses routing protocols and algorithms
