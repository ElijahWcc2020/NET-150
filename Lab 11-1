You can create VLANs by configuring each one in a switch via Config > SWITCHING > VLAN Database > Add
Then, you have to assign the VLANs to each port Congig > INTERFACE > FastEthernet 0/1 (this is just an example of one port)
  here is also where you can specify whether a port is an access port or a trunk port

Truck ports are for connections between different switches.
  (I am not entirely sure why they are needed or how they functionally differ from regular ports)


Troubleshooting:

Because I was unsure of how to configure trunk ports, I did some research. Links to some videos/websites I visited are listed below (I also took some time to look into other areas I was unsure of).
